# CHANGELOG — Atelier worktree

The PR-by-PR ship log. New entries go at the **top**. Each entry is one line for index value + a short paragraph for context. Doctrine and forward planning live in `CLAUDE.md` and `ROADMAP.md` respectively.

## Recent (2026-05-18)

**PR#176 — Post-audit fixes: crew_travel super bug + accounting bucket + expense ASF + auth gates.** Four issues surfaced by the post-simplification audit (`docs/AUDIT-2026-05-18.md`), all fixed in one shot. (P0-1) `src/app/print/bookings/[id]/crew/[crewId]/page.tsx`: `crew_travel` was incorrectly grouped with `crew_labour` in `LABOUR_TYPES`, which would have over-paid super by 12% on every crew travel line. Renamed `OVERTIME_TYPES` → `NON_SUPER_LABOUR_TYPES` covering both crew_overtime and crew_travel; passed the combined subtotal to `computeCrewPayment`'s `overtimeSubtotal` slot (the function already treats that bucket as GST-bearing non-super, so no math change needed). (P0-2) `src/app/print/bookings/[id]/accounting/page.tsx`: `crew_travel` wasn't bucketed at all in the per-crew payment loop, silently dropping crew-linked travel lines from the accounting statement. New `CREW_NON_SUPER_TYPES = {crew_overtime, crew_travel}` set; both flow into `crewOvertimeByCrew` map. (P1 ASF) `addExpenseLineAction` was defaulting ASF to 0 when CLAUDE.md doctrine says expense lines default to 15% — under-charging margin on every post-shoot expense added via the OT/Expenses widget. Now reads `lineTypeDefaults('expense')` for the canonical rate. `createExpenseLine` test helper stays at 0% (it's a test convenience, not a production path; production goes through the server action). AJE eComm #3579 canonical still byte-identical. (P1 auth) `generateQuoteFromTemplateAction`, `addOTLineAction`, `addExpenseLineAction` all gained `requireOwnerOrPartner()` guards + `logAudit()` calls — these three were exposed without auth/audit, theoretically callable by any signed-in user including portal accounts. Closes all P0/P1 findings from the audit; P2 cleanup (dead code, stale comments) deferred to a separate sweep.

**PR#175 — Consolidate line types: 22 → 10 (Phase 3/3, simplification complete).** Final phase of the Jasper-approved fee-line refactor. Migration 0062 adds `expense` enum value. Migration 0063 remaps prod rows: `retouching → post_production` (0 rows, future-proof) and 11 expense/rental subtypes → `expense` (8 rows: 4 crew_equipment + 4 equipment_rental). Net 22 line types → 10. `FeeLineType` union narrowed to the 10 active values; dropped values stay in the Postgres enum for backward compat. `FEE_LINE_TYPE_LABELS`, `ARTIST_LABOUR_LINE_TYPES`, `ALWAYS_GST_LINE_TYPES` (now empty — rentals lost their special-case), `CREW_LINE_TYPES_SET` (now includes `expense` so the picker shows up for expense lines), `LINE_TYPE_OPTIONS` all updated. OTExpenseEntry's 10-item expense-type dropdown removed — just `expense` + description. Print pages, JobPnLPanel, accounting page, person-billing, quote-templates all updated. AJE eComm #3579 canonical test still byte-identical (uses `expense` instead of `catering` — math unchanged). 212 tests green. CLAUDE.md fee model doctrine block rewritten to reflect the consolidated set.

**PR#174 — Drop `is_artist_reimbursement` flag, derive from talent link (Phase 2/3).** Pre-flight SQL on prod confirmed zero rows would change meaning under the new derivation rule vs the legacy column (both directions checked). New `isReimbursement(line)` helper in `fee-engine.ts`: returns `true` iff `talent_id != null && !is_commissionable`. Every read of `line.is_artist_reimbursement` across the codebase replaced with `isReimbursement(line)` — accounting print, JobPnLPanel, QuoteBuilder filter logic + "REIMB" badge. Edit row + add-line form lost the "Mark as artist reimbursement" tickbox; the talent picker IS the signal now. Server actions (`addFeeLineAction`, `updateFeeLineAction`, `addExpenseLineAction`) stop reading or writing the column on insert/update. `is_artist_reimbursement` column STAYS in the Postgres schema for backward compat with old rows — never touched, never read. Closes the half-state bug class (flag set without person linked, or person linked but flag not set) — the 2 orphan rows fixed in PR#173 were exactly this.

## Recent (2026-05-17)

**PR#173 — Crew prefix rename + orphan reimbursement strip (Phase 1/3 of fee-line simplification).** First step of Jasper-approved simplification. Migration 0060: strips 2 orphan reimbursement rows (BOOK-0006 $3,600 + BOOK-0002 $500 — both equipment lines flagged `is_artist_reimbursement=true` with no `talent_id`; Jasper chose Path A = treat as agency-paid, conservative). Same migration adds `crew_overtime` + `crew_travel` enum values. Migration 0061 (separate transaction): UPDATE existing 4 `overtime` rows → `crew_overtime`. No `travel` rows in prod, so that mapping is no-op. Code: 25 callsite updates across QuoteBuilder, JobPnLPanel, accounting/quote/invoice/confirmation/crew prints, quote-templates, fee-engine test, plus FEE_LINE_TYPE_LABELS and FeeLineType union. Old `overtime`/`travel` enum values retained in Postgres to avoid the destructive enum-recreation. AJE eComm #3579 canonical test updated to use the new `crew_travel` value — still byte-identical. 212 tests passing.

**PR#172 — BriefParser + Settings polish.** Three small things landed together. (a) "Apply N fields" button label now shows "+ usage" suffix when the structured taxonomy block applies alongside the checkboxes, so the count matches reality. (b) Heuristic-mode amber banner gains a "Check status →" link to `/settings#integrations` for one-click verification (the Integrations section is the source of truth for whether the runtime sees `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). (c) Settings → Anthropic API row now flips back to "pending" with "API key detected — but LLM calls blocked by RED kill switch" detail when the env var is set but the kill switch is RED — closes the silent-kill-switch failure mode where the row said "Connected" while every LLM call returned `reason=kill_switch`.

**PR#171 — Kill 5-min auto-refresh + simplification proposal doc.** `PullToRefresh.tsx` was calling `router.refresh()` every 5 minutes via `setInterval` — mid-form typing → re-render → lost focus. Killed the timer, kept the pull-to-refresh gesture. Same PR landed `docs/SIMPLIFICATION-PROPOSAL-2026-05-17.md`: deep analysis of the proposed fee-line refactor (22 line types → ~10), full current truth table, 22-types-to-5-fee-engine-groups grouping, pre-flight SQL run against prod (2 orphan reimbursement rows + 9 line types in use across 41 rows + AJE canonical test safe), 4-PR migration sequence, 5 open questions for Jasper. Analysis only — no code refactor; awaiting decisions.

**PR#170 — Structured usage taxonomy: migration + apply path + display chips.** Migration 0059 adds five nullable columns to `atelier_bookings`: `usage_market` (consumer/trade/editorial), `usage_realm` (advertising/promotional/pr/corporate/editorial), `usage_media_categories text[]` (online/broadcast/print/outdoor/ambient), `usage_specific_channels text[]` (snake_case like `social_paid`/`edm`/`billboard`), `usage_territory_iso text[]` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 + region aggregates WW/EU/EMEA/etc.). CHECK constraints enforce the enum vocab on `usage_market`, `usage_realm`, `usage_media_categories`, and `usage_territory_iso` — `usage_specific_channels` left unconstrained because the long-tail grows with the industry. `applyBriefSuggestionsAction` now accepts the new fields (comma-separated for arrays in FormData), validates server-side against the same allowlists baked into the DB constraints, silently drops unknown values. `BriefParser` surfaces a "Detected usage taxonomy" preview block with read-only chips (market/realm/media-categories/territories) and channel list — applied as an indivisible group with the rest of the suggestions. Booking detail Usage section renders the same chips above `UsageLicenceBuilder` so the persisted taxonomy is visible across the lifecycle. Generated types regenerated against prod; `Booking` hand-type extended; `database.compat.test.ts` still passes.

**PR#169 — Brief intake regression fixtures + heuristic date fixes + LLM taxonomy.** Five .txt fixture briefs (Venroy 3 variants + Inaura producer-side + Coronation cold enquiry) at `src/lib/automation/__tests__/brief-intake.fixtures/` with `expected.ts` carrying `heuristic` (asserted) + `idealLlm` (documentation) tiers. 27 new tests. The fixtures surfaced 5 real heuristic bugs all fixed in `brief-parser.ts`: (a) `/\bshoot\s+date\b/i` matching referring phrases like "the shoot date on 27 May" → tightened to require a declarative marker; (b) no trigger for "shoot a full day on" → added two new triggers; (c) label regex `[:\s]+` greedily crossing blank lines and leaking "Brand Inaura" into `shoot_date_notes` → tightened to require colon; (d) no "X and Y of Month" range pattern in `parseDateFragment` → added; (e) location captured with trailing period → stripped. Net field-extraction lift: avg 3 → avg 4.8 per brief. LLM system prompt extended with structured usage taxonomy enums + synonym maps (eDMs/EDMs/Emails → `edm`, Aus./Australia → `AU`) + talent-count-vs-photographer disambiguation. `BriefIntakeResult` gains a `StructuredUsage` mixin.

**PR#168 — Resurrect Usage panel + remove BUR calc.** Two bugs in one. (a) `UsageLicenceBuilder` was nested inside `BookingDetail`'s Brief section which is gated on `!suppressHeader` — and the booking detail page passes `suppressHeader={true}` to use `BookingJobFacts` instead. JobFacts didn't include usage, so the panel was rendered nowhere. Surfaced as its own section under JobFacts in `/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`. (b) BUR calculator removed — it was a fake `multiplier × base_rate = fee` UI dressed as a calculator. `bur_multiplier` DB column retained for existing rows; new rows leave it null.

**PR#167 — Crew portal: surface fee_lines (OT/expenses/equipment) per booking.** Parity fix from the PR#165 ripple audit: talent portal already showed fee_lines but crew portal didn't, so a crew member who clocked OT post-shoot saw only their roster day rate. `getCrewPortalData` now fetches `atelier_fee_lines` filtered by `crew_id`; new "Fees" column on the crew-portal booking table + native `<details>` row beneath with the line breakdown. SSR-only.

**PR#166 — BriefParser render bugs + heuristic-mode banner.** Brief auto-parser on BOOK-0008 was showing a checkbox with `[object Object]` and another with a bare "3". Root cause: `META_KEYS` was a denylist (`source, confidence, llmAvailable, uncertainty_sources, critique`) and the `contract` field added in PR#32 (ConfidenceContract doctrine) leaked through; `talent_count` did too despite the file's own comment saying it was intentionally excluded. Fix: switched `dataKeys` from `Object.keys(suggestions).filter(!META)` (denylist) to `Object.keys(FIELD_LABELS)` (allowlist) — any future field added to `BriefIntakeResult` is now invisible by default. New `formatSuggestionValue(key, value)` chokepoint formats dates as "Thu 22 May 2026" and counts as "10 deliverables"; falls back to JSON for any object so we never leak `[object Object]` again. Plus: heuristic-mode notice promoted from grey footer span to warning-tinted banner with the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instruction inline; Re-parse button stays available after success.

## Recent (2026-05-16)

**Cron unification — 4 reminder routes → 1.** `quote-chase`, `post-shoot-chase`, `talent-gallery-ping`, `compliance-pings` (which also handled business renewals) all had the same auth → kill-switch → log _run → match → insert approval → log _complete shape. Now a single `/api/cron/scheduled-comms` route iterates `REMINDER_RULES` from `src/lib/automation/reminder-rules.ts`. Six rules: quote-chase, post-shoot, talent gallery, crew gallery, talent compliance docs, agency business renewals. Per-rule failure isolation (one bad match doesn't black out the rest). Same idempotency keys → cut-over is no-op for already-queued drafts. Net: -797 LOC across the 4 old routes; 4 cron secrets → 1; 4 schedules → 1. Adding a new reminder is now an array entry in `reminder-rules.ts`, not a new route.

**PR#157 — Regenerate generated types + bidirectional exhaustiveness check.** Regenerated `database.generated.ts` from prod schema (was 19+ migrations stale). Upgraded `database.compat.test.ts` to use `Exclude<keyof TGenerated, keyof THand>` — every column in the generated row must exist on the hand type or tsc fails with `{ missing_in_hand: "column_name" }`. 23 tables checked, 3 real drifts found and fixed (Booking missing `is_archived`/`archived_at`, Talent missing `onboarding_token_expires_at`, BookingTalent missing `created_at`).

**PR#156 — Split CLAUDE.md into doctrine + CHANGELOG + ROADMAP.** CLAUDE.md was 386 lines covering doctrine + build status + phase order + forward roadmap + standing checks. ~70% was changelog material masquerading as doctrine. Split: CLAUDE.md is now 204 lines (doctrine only, readable in 5 min); CHANGELOG.md holds the PR-by-PR ship log; ROADMAP.md holds forward planning. Memory-sync doctrine updated to point at the three files.

**PR#155 — Model 404 fallback safety net.** Single-hop fallback chain: on a 404 from a current-gen model ID, retry once with the prior-generation counterpart from the `AnthropicModel` type union. `console.warn` on every fallback so model rot surfaces in logs. Direct response to the PR-E risk: I bumped IDs without live API verification.

**PR#154 — Data-driven talent nicknames.** Migration 0057 adds `nicknames text[]` to `atelier_talent`, seeded with `Oly → Oliver Begg`. TalentEditForm exposes comma-separated input. `/inbox` brief-detection query selects `nicknames` alongside `working_name` — heuristics scale with the roster, no more code edits.

**PR#153 — Anthropic prompt caching + model bump + latent insert fix.** `anthropic.ts` builds `system` as blocks with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` (two breakpoints: trifecta clause + per-purpose prompt). Default haiku-tier bumped to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; AnthropicModel union keeps prior-gen IDs as fallbacks. Migration 0056 fixes a latent insert mismatch where `anthropic.ts` had referenced columns (`purpose`, `cost_usd`, `success`, `response_preview`) that didn't exist. New `computeLlmCallCost()` helper makes the cost math testable (7 new tests). Voice rules refactored to derive sign-off from `agency-config.ts` (pre-commit hook caught the hardcoded literal).

**PR#152 (PR-D) — P2 polish sweep (9 findings).** Auth/audit gaps on campaigns/usage-licences/tasks. Silent `.limit(200/500)` caps converted to observed ceilings (`.range(...)` + `console.warn`). Cron doctrine: `tomorrow-digest` emits `_complete` event. Model-version hygiene in seed-costs. Accessibility: kill-switch toggle `aria-label`. TOCTOU on portal hold responses (`.eq('status', row.status)`).

**PR#151 (PR-C) — P1: cron + portal hardening.** Kill-switch gate on `auto-anonymise` + `tomorrow-digest` crons (auto-anonymise is irreversible — RED must defer). `/api/instagram/profile` is owner/partner only. `proposeHoldRequestsAction` requires owner/partner + audit-logged. Portal preview mode disables action buttons with "Preview — read-only" hint.

**PR#150 (PR-B) — P1: overtime/super split + revalidation + handlers.** `computeCrewPayment` extended with optional `overtimeSubtotal` param — overtime is GST-bearing but NOT super-bearing. Quote totals were always correct (line-level `is_super_bearing` worked); JobPnLPanel + accounting + crew bill print were overstating super by 12% of OT. AJE eComm #3579 canonical test still byte-identical. `quotes-public.ts` accept/decline calls `revalidatePath('/bookings/<id>')` + `revalidateTag('bookings', {})`. `approval-effects.ts` explicit no-op cases for `hold_response_notify` + `onboarding_review` (silenced "no handler" warn).

**PR#149 (PR-A) — P0 auth lockdown.** `provisionAppUserAction` / `toggleAppUserActiveAction` / `deleteAppUserAction` in `app-users.ts` + `toggleKillSwitchAction` in `kill-switch.ts` had no auth guard and used the service client. Any authenticated portal user could elevate themselves to owner or freeze the platform. `requireOwnerOrPartner()` added to all four. Kill-switch attempts also write `kill_switch.*.toggle_failed` audit rows for security visibility.

**PR#148 — Dev guards (pre-commit + pre-push hooks).** Zero-dep wiring via `.githooks/` + `prepare` script. Pre-commit blocks hardcoded `"Saunders & Co"` / `"Jasper Bailey"` / agency emails (allowlist: agency-config, tests, comments, env-fallbacks, `// HARDCODED-OK`). Pre-push runs `tsc --noEmit` + `vitest run`. `npm run preflight` runs both on demand. Caught real violations within the same session.

**PR#147 — Grid Planner 4:5 aspect + real `@saundersandcoagency` data.** Aspect ratio fixed (was 9:16 — IG's actual feed grid is 4:5). `/api/instagram/profile` uses `facebookexternalhit/1.1` UA (regular browser UAs stopped returning OG tags after IG's late-2024 client-render migration). Real avatar + display name + handle in the phone mockup. "Stats as of HH:MM" + Refresh button.

**PR#146 — Grid Planner redesign with image persistence.** IndexedDB storage for image blobs (`idb-storage.ts`). Scheduled-date + content-type indicators on slots. Bulk multi-file upload with overflow-to-empty-slots. 160px image-preview + flex form layout.

**PR#145 — Cost vs billed split on fee lines.** Migration 0055 adds nullable `cost_subtotal` column. `effectiveCost(line) = cost_subtotal ?? subtotal`. ASF + GST + super-charged on billed; commission + super-paid on cost. New "Spread captured" agency-margin row in JobPnLPanel when cost < billed. AJE eComm #3579 canonical test passes byte-identical (no `cost_subtotal` set).

## 2026-05 dashboard / undo / list redesign wave (PRs #115-#126)

**PR#125-126 — Upcoming-shoots filter + hover card stays on screen.** `getUpcomingShoots()` was returning past bookings (no date filter). Calendar hover card clipped at month edges. Refactored to React portal + `position: fixed` from `getBoundingClientRect()` with measure-and-flip. Touch devices skip popover via `matchMedia('(hover: hover)')`. PR#126 expanded state filter to all pre-shoot states.

**PR#124 — Drag-reorder of fee lines persists reliably.** `.upsert({id, sort_order}, {onConflict: 'id'})` silently failed because PostgREST validates INSERT side of ON CONFLICT against NOT NULL columns. Fix: individual `.update()` per-row in parallel via Promise.all. Bonus `fee_line_reorder` audit row.

**PR#123 — Dashboard equal heights + inbox briefs preview.** Side-by-side panels match height via `h-full` detection in SectionCard. InboxPreview shows potential brief candidates from Gmail alongside pending approvals.

**PR#122 — Dashboard layout v2.** 3-col / 4-row grid matching Jasper's sketch. Calendar + Upcoming + Crew-on-hold + Jobs-needing-crew + Pipeline + Inbox + Kill switch + Finance.

**PR#121 — Dashboard redesign v1.** Six new components: GreetingHeader, MiniMonthCalendar, FinanceSection, ThisWeekStrip, InboxPreview, SettingsSnapshot. `lib/data/dashboard.ts` data layer.

**PR#120 — Hotfix: dismissed_by uuid → text.** Migration 0051 declared the column as `uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id)` but the app uses `getCurrentActor()` which returns email. Migration 0052 drops FK + alters to text.

**PR#119 — Undo trio.** Reject-approval + delete-fee-line + delete-schedule-row all get the toast-undo pattern from PR#118. New shared `<UndoToast>` component.

**PR#118 — Dismiss-brief persistence + convert-to-booking undo.** PotentialBriefs panel was dismissing in React local state only. Migration 0051 creates `atelier_dismissed_brief_candidates` + adds `source_gmail_message_id` to bookings. Two undo layers: 8s toast + persistent "Show N dismissed" toggle. Established **reversibility doctrine** — actions undoable UNTIL external side effect.

**PR#117 (Redesign PR-3) — Settings + Inbox dense layouts.** Settings KpiStrip + 3-col Admin/Toggles/Push + 2-col Profile/Defaults + full-width Integrations + 4-col Scheduled Jobs. Inbox KpiStrip + inline tab pills.

**PR#116 (Redesign PR-2) — Shared KpiCard + SectionCard across 5 overview pages.** Dashboard / Reports / Compliance / Renewals / Costs now share one visual idiom.

**PR#115 (Redesign PR-1) — Shared DenseListTable across 5 list pages.** Talent / Crew / Clients / Locations / Audit — 3-col card grids → sortable dense rows (~5× density), inline filter bar, optional grouping with localStorage-persisted collapse.

**PR#114 — Kill switch UX + Realtime banner + audit deep-link.** React 19 `useOptimistic` on the toggle (was ~10s lag). Migration 0050 adds `atelier_kill_switch` to `supabase_realtime` publication. Banner "X email operations failed" now links per-action to `/audit?action=<name>`.

## Workflow + privacy wave (PRs #65-#99)

**PR#99 — Fix all P1s and P2s from AUDIT-2026-05-14B (17 P1s + 13 P2s).** Five thematic groups: (A) quick wins (QuoteActions refresh, attention sort, StageChecklist optional items grey, BookingTeam empty state). (B) notification gaps (onboarding_review + hold_response_notify). (C) data correctness (auto-upsert schedule rows on shoot_dates change, hold-requests awaited, HoldExpiryBadge 60s refresh). (D) UX polish + infrastructure (GridPlanner localStorage, /q/[token] expiry, QuoteBuilder ASF tooltip, Settings Gmail failure banner + cron health table, all crons emit `_run`/`_complete`). (E) email + batch (buildRemittanceEmail, markTalent/CrewPaid remittance, approveAllHoldsAction).

**PR#91 — Surface real DB error on fee-line save + auth guard.** Generic "Failed to update" was masking RLS denial, enum mismatch, constraint failure. `updateFeeLine` returns `{ ok, data | error: message · code · details · hint }`.

**PR#90 — Block reimbursement on commissionable lines + split overtime artist/crew.** Migration 0046 adds `artist_overtime` enum. `artist_overtime` commissionable; `overtime` stays crew OT.

**PR#89 — QuoteBuilder edits not propagating.** `commitEdit` was missing `router.refresh()` after successful save. Fee-line table updated optimistically but JobPnLPanel kept stale prop data.

**PR#88 — QuoteBuilder edit-row redesign + UI polish.** Edit row redesigned from 10-column squeeze to single-cell colSpan. Sticky totals panel. PrintDocsMenu dropdown collapses 6 buttons.

**PR#87 — Print template fixes + artist portal fees + PDF performance.** Quote PDF totals reorder (GST before Crew Fringes). Category grouping on Quote + Confirmation PDFs. Shared `pdf-renderer.ts` utility (blocks images/fonts, uses `'load'` not `'networkidle0'`).

**AUDIT-2026-05-14 + 6 fix PRs (A-F).** First comprehensive audit; 0 P0, 11 P1, 13 P2 findings. `requireOwnerOrPartner()` on all 14 entity mutations + 3 location mutations. Schedule delete confirm. HoldExpiryBadge timezone fix via Intl. Public quote audit-log. BookingTabs `?tab=` URL sync. Hardcoded hex sweep. JobPnLPanel empty state.

**PR#74 (Syngency-inspired) — 6 features.** 5-tab booking detail restructure (BookingTabs). Quote accept/decline on /q/[token]. Talent bookouts (migration 0040). Tasks system (migration 0041, polymorphic booking/talent/crew). Booking Confirmation print template. Per-day schedules (migration 0042).

**PR#66 — Security + UX hardening.** Auth guards on markTalent/CrewPaid + sendQuickEmail. Booking state check on payroll. Server-side email format validation. Same-artist guard in substituteTalentAction. Migration 0038 adds `confirmed_at`.

**PR#65 — Workflow UX: JobPnLPanel + morning-after urgency + QuickCompose + talent substitution.** JobPnLPanel per booking. Red "OT window closes in Xh" badge on dashboard. QuickCompose panel. Inline talent substitute with audit trail.

**PR#64 — Portal interactivity.** Migration 0037. Talent/crew respond to hold requests. Talent confirms day rate + acknowledges brief. Crew self-reports unavailability. Digital call sheets in both portals.

## What's not built / blocked

- **Phase 2 (Xero invoice sync)** — blocked on `XERO_CLIENT_ID`, `XERO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `XERO_REDIRECT_URI` env vars
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** — code is wired but LLM features degrade to no-op without the key
- **`CRON_SECRET`** — needed in Vercel Production env scope for crons to fire
- Microsoft Graph webhooks (no MS Graph code in the build)
